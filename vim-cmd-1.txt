VIM Code Navigation
=======================
1) CTAGS: - 
    $ctags -R
    => If this command is run at root directory then it created a navigation
    file "tags", which provides very flexible navigation.
    Also we can run 
    ctags -R *
  
    a) vim -t "tag"
    Example: - $vim -t title
    => It searches for a specific tag and open the output in Vim to its definition.
    
    Instead of above commmand we can also open any Linux source file in Vim and can use the 
    following basic commands:
 
    Ctrl + ] => Jump to the tag underneath the cursor
    
    Ctrl-t => Jump back up in the tag stack

    :ts <tag> <RET> => Search for a particular tag

    :tn => Go to the next definition for the last tag

    :tp => Go to the previous definition for the last tag

    :ts => List all of the definitions of the last tag

    The tn and tp commands can be used to scroll through them, and the ts command can be used
    to "search" a list for the definition we want.
    
    We can also search a tag by tagname.
    Type as below in vim editor in command mode: -
    :tag <tag name>
    
    Example: -
    :tag my_spi
    
2) Vim and ctags: -
    We can configure vim editor so that it can work for browsing code, even if a source file
    is away from the directory from where it was created. For this we modify vimrc file.
    We have to add location of tags file in vimrc.
    
    sudo vim ~/.vimrc
    set tags+=$HOME/path/of/tags/file
