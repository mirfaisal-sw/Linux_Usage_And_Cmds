1.) Linux command to find a string in all files in all directories: -
   $ grep -ri pinctrl-single *
=> If this command is run on any directory then it will find out 
   in which files he string "pinctrl-single" is there. It checks by reading files 
   by going into various files even present in various sub directories recursively.
   
   Other way:-
   $ grep -inR "cs > max 2"
   
=> To search group of words with sapce use escape character "\" before space.
   For example, to search "Multi Boot", use below command.
   $ grep -ri Multi\ Boot
   
2.) Linux command to find a file in all directories.
    $ find . -name thisfile.txt
    
3.) To see live view of a important file, use watch command. It is shown as example as
    below.
    $watch -n1 "cat /proc/interrupts"
    
4.) Use "du" command to know size of file or folder.
    Example: -
    $ du -h <folder/file name>
    
    $du -sh .
    
5.) Symbolic link command: -
    To create a symbolic link named my_link.txt to a file named my_file.txt.
    $ ln -s my_file.txt my_link.txt
    
    Other Example: -
    $ mkdir -p a/b/c/d/my_file.txt
    $ ln -sf a/b/c/d/my_file.txt my_link.txt
    $ ls -l
    O/p - 
    my_link.txt -> a/b/c/d/my_file.txt
    
6.) Compress and decompress commands: -
    a.) Create .tar.gz file
    # tar -czvf file.tar.gz <directory to be compressed>
    
    b.) Extract .tar.gz file
    # tar -xzvf projects.tar.gz
    
    We can extract files in a given directory such as /tmp/:
    # tar -xzvf projects.tar.gz -C /tmp/
